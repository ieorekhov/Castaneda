Four moods of stalking:
1. ruthlessness should not be harshness
2. Cunning (хитрость, пронырливость, искусность)
should not be cruelty

3. patience should not be negligence
4. sweetness should not be foolishness.

"Sorcerers use the four moods of stalking as guides," he continued. "These are four different
frames of mind, four different brands of intensity that sorcerers can use to induce their
assemblage points to move to specific positions."
He taught him that these four steps had to be practiced and perfected until they were so smooth
they were unnoticeable. 








### Seven principles of the art of stalking
1. The first principle of the art of stalking is that warriors choose their battleground. A warrior never goes into battle without knowing what the surroundings are.
2. To discard everything that is unnecessary is the second principle of the art of stalking.
3. Don't complicate things, aim at being simple. Apply all the concentration you have to decide whether or not to enter into battle, for any battle is a battle for one's life. This is the third principle of the art of stalking, A warrior must be willing and ready to make his last stand here and now. But not in a helter-skelter way.
4. Relax, abandon yourself, fear nothing. Only then will the powers that guide us open the road and aid us. Only then."
5. "When faced with odds that cannot be dealt with, warriors retreat for a moment," she said. "They let their minds mean-der. They occupy their time with something else. Anything would do.

Warriors compress time; even an instant counts. In a battle for your life, a second is an eternity; an eternity that may decide the outcome. War-riors aim at succeeding, therefore they compress time. War-riors don't waste an instant."

"My benefactor was the chief," Florinda said. "And yet, looking at him, no one would've ever
believed it. He always had one of his female warriors as a front while he freely mingled with
the patients pretending to be one of them; or he posed as an old fool who was constantly
sweeping dry leaves with a handmade broom."
Florinda explained that in order to apply the seventh prin-ciple of the art of stalking, one has
to apply the other six. Thus her benefactor was always looking on from behind the scenes.
Thanks to that he was capable of avoiding or parrying con-flicts. If there was strife, it was
never directed toward him, but towards his front, the female warrior. 


"Applying these principles brings about three results. The first is that stalkers learn never to
take themselves seriously. They learn to laugh at themselves. If they're not afraid of being a
fool, they can fool anyone. The second is that stalkers learn to have endless patience. Stalkers
are never in a hurry. They never fret. And the third is that stalkers learn to have an end-less
capacity to improvise." 




















The idea of death therefore is of monumental importance in the life of a sorcerer. I have shown you innumerable things about death to convince you that the knowledge of your impending and avoidable end is what gives us sobriety.
> impending - предстоящий, грозящий

Without a clear view of death, there is no order, no sobriety, no beauty. Sorcerers struggle to gain this crucial insight in order to help them realize at the deepest possible level that they have no assurance whatsoever their lives will continue beyond the moment.

That realazation gives sorcerers the courage to be patient and yet take action, courage to be acquiescent without being stupid.
> aquiescient - податливый, покорный


Sorcerers stalk themselves in order to break the power of their obsessions. There are **many** ways of stalking oneself. If you don't want to use the idea of your death, use the poems you read me to stalk yourself.
> obsession - одержимость, навязчивая идея

The spirit could not possibly have cared about my despair. There were too many of us — men with our own petty private hells, born of our stupidity — for the spirit to pay attention.
>despair - отчаяние, безнадежность\
petty - мелочный, ничтожный, пустяковый

For a sorcerer, ruthlessness is not cruelty. Ruthlessness is the opposite of self-pity or self-importance. Ruthlessness is sobriety.
>sobriety - трезвость
