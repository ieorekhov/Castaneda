The idea of death therefore is of monumental importance in the life of a sorcerer. I have shown you innumerable things about death to convince you that the knowledge of your impending and avoidable end is what gives us sobriety.
> impending - предстоящий, грозящий

Without a clear view of death, there is no order, no sobriety, no beauty. Sorcerers struggle to gain this crucial insight in order to help them realize at the deepest possible level that they have no assurance whatsoever their lives will continue beyond the moment.

That realazation gives sorcerers the courage to be patient and yet take action, courage to be acquiescent without being stupid.
> aquiescient - податливый, покорный


Sorcerers stalk themselves in order to break the power of their obsessions. There are **many** ways of stalking oneself. If you don't want to use the idea of your death, use the poems you read me to stalk yourself.
> obsession - одержимость, навязчивая идея

The spirit could not possibly have cared about my despair. There were too many of us — men with our own petty private hells, born of our stupidity — for the spirit to pay attention.
>despair - отчаяние, безнадежность\
petty - мелочный, ничтожный, пустяковый

For a sorcerer, ruthlessness is not cruelty. Ruthlessness is the opposite of self-pity or self-importance. Ruthlessness is sobriety.
>sobriety - трезвость
