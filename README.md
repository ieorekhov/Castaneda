>The conditions of a solitary bird are five:\
The first, that it flies to the highest point;\
the second, that it does not suffer for company, not even of its own kind;\ 
the third, that it aims its beak to the skies;\
the fourth, that it does not have a definite color;\
the fifth, that it sings very softly.
