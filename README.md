>The conditions of a solitary bird are five:\
The first, that it flies to the highest point;\
The second, that it does not suffer for company, not even of its own kind;\
The third, that it aims its beak to the skies;\
The fourth, that it does not have a definite color;\
The fifth, that it sings very softly.
